# An Analysis of Ride-Sharing Data

## Project Overview
Performed data analysis on ride-sharing data to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Analysis

The Pyber ride-sharing data shows that the average fares in urban cities were typically lower than in suburban and rural cities.

![Ride_Count_Data](https://github.com/frlinh/pyber-analysis/blob/4796f5ae0646f15c5042490159e72e676bbe9bf0/Resources/Fig2.png)
The ride count chart shows that there is one outlier in the urban ride count data.  In addition, the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 3 times lower per city than in suburban cities and 4 times lower per city than in urban cities.

![Ride_Fare_Data](https://github.com/frlinh/pyber-analysis/blob/4796f5ae0646f15c5042490159e72e676bbe9bf0/Resources/Fig3.png)
The ride fare chart shows that the average fare for rides in rural cities is about $5 more per ride than in suburban cities and about $10 more per ride than in urban cities.

The driver count chart shows that the average number of drivers in rural cities is four times less per city than in suburban cities and nine times less per city than in urban cities.

The total fares by city type pie chart show that urban cities generated 62.7% of the total fares, while suburban cities generated 30.5%, and rural cities generated 6.8% of the total fares.

The total rides by city type pie chart show that urban cities shared 68.4% of the total rides, while suburban cities shared 26.3% and rural cities shares 5.3% of the total rides.

The total drivers by city type pie chart show that urban cities formed 80.9% of total drivers, while suburban cities formed 16.5% and rural cities formed 2.6% of total drivers.

## Summary
Drivers in rural cities earned an average of $38 more than drivers in urban cities. The average fare per ride is approximately $10 more in rural cities than in urban cities.  To mitigate the imbalance of fare prices and fare earnings the business recommendations below are necessary to ensure affordability among different city types and to balance fare earnings per ride.

Business Recommendation:
- Increase the fare prices in urban cities to balance the average fare to approximately $30 per ride
- Decrease the fare prices in rural cities to balance the average fare to approximately $30 per ride
- Analyze ride data further to determine peak times, ride distances, and the number of rides per day.
